# Travel Planner App

This is the Final Project in the Udacity Front End Engineering Nanodegree

## What it is

This is a travel planning app where you can enter in where you want to travel too and when  
and it will return some information about where you are going and the weather there. This app  
showcases Node, Express, Sass, Webpack and Fetch  

## Additional Project Features
Add end date and display length of trip.  
Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).  
Allow the user to remove the trip.  
Use Local Storage to save the data so that when they close, then revisit the page, their information is still there.  
Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.  
Incorporate icons into forecast.  
Allow the user to add additional trips  
Automatically sort additional trips by countdown.
